This website is a static site generated by Hugo framework. It was written by [Fastbyte01](https://github.com/Fastbyte01), copied and edited by me and then stored on github. After all this was done, it was hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). To add a little bit charm to the website, I got a free .tk domain name from [Freenom](https://freenom.com).

## A few words about Hugo
Hugo is world's **fastest** static site generator written in [Go](https://golang.com). You can build beautiful, robust sites within minutes and then generate them (normally) in less than __1 second__.
For newbies, there are a few free [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io). You don't even require the basic knowledge of web dev to get your site up and running within an hour.

## About Netlify
Netlify is a Content Delivery Network which boasts being the industry standard when it comes to hosting static site all over the globe. If you don't want to try Netlify you can use any other platform like Cloudflare pages, github pages, etc.

## Credits
I am very thankful to [fastbyte01](https://github.com/fastbyte01) for making such an awesome theme and that too making it open source for everyone to enjoy. Kudos.
